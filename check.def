 the reported value of _diffrn_measured_fraction_theta_max. Their ratio is  
 reported when less than 1.0. When theta_full is less than theta_max such

# >>> Check Rint
_020 0.12 0.18 0.25 3 A   0 1 0 0   
The value of Rint is greater than 0.12 ......... $F Report  

 The value of Rint (i.e. _diffrn_reflns_av_R_equivalents) should normally be
 considerably less than 0.12 and in the order of magnitude of the reported  
 R-values. Rint may be relatively meaningless when based on a very limited  
 number of averaged data. Higher values should be accompanied by a suitable 
 explanation in the _publ_section_exptl_refinement section. However,
 authors should first ensure that there are not overlooked problems 
 associated with the data or the space-group. Elevated values for   
 _diffrn_reflns_av_R_equivalents may be indicative of a need to recollect   
 the data from a crystal of higher quality or that there is a problem with  
 the data treatment. Consider the following:
 (a) The absorption corrections are inadequate or inappropriate.
 (b) The overall quality of the data may be poor due to the crystal quality.
 (c) The crystal is very weakly diffracting, so that a large proportion of  
     essentially "unobserved" reflections are being used in the refinement. 
     You should consider using a better crystal or a data collection at 
     low temperature and/or, if the compound is organic, using Cu radiation.
 (d) You are working in the wrong crystal system or Laue group. 
 (e) You have only a very small number of equivalent reflections, which 
     may lead to artificially high values of _diffrn_reflns_av_R_equivalents

 Note that if _diffrn_reflns_av_sigmaI/netI is also large, the quality  
 of the data should be considered to be suspect.

 The expected number of reflections corresponds to that in the asymmetric   
 unit of the Laue group. Expected ratio: less-or-equal 1 for centro symmetric   
 structures and less than 2 for non-centrosymmetric structures. 
 Reasons to exceed those numbers can be:
  1 - Systematic extinctions not omitted from the observed data count.

 Ideally (and a requirement for publication in Acta Crystallographica),

 -diffrn-measured-fraction-theta-full (close to 1.0), up to 
 sin(theta)/lambda = 0.6 (i.e. 25.24 degrees MoKa). 
 The three major causes of incomplete data sets are:
 1 - A missing cusp of data due to data collection by rotation around   
     the spindle axis only (standard on some image-plate systems).  
     Cure: collect an additional data set after remounting the crystal. 
 2 - The DENZO image processing package has problems with certain strong
     reflections. They are often excluded from the data set.
     Cure: Add an additional scan at lower power setting in order to
     include strong low order reflections.

 Ideally (and a requirement for publication in Acta Crystallographica), 
 this fraction should be close to 1.0 for theta-full greater or equal   
 to sin(theta/lambda) = 0.6 (i.e. 25.24 degrees for MoKa and 67.7 degrees   
 for CuKa  radiation).  
 The three major causes of incomplete data sets are:
 1 - A missing cusp of data due to data collection by rotation around   
     the spindle axis only (standard on some image-plate systems).  
     Cure: collect an additional data set after remounting the crystal. 
 2 - The DENZO imageprocessing package has problems with certain strong 
     reflections. They are often excluded from the data set.
     Cure: Add an additional scan at lower power setting in order to
     include strong low order reflections.  
 3 - Incomplete scans, possibly based on erroneously assumed higher than
     actual symmetry.   

 Note: The default value of _diffrn_measured_fraction_theta_full that   
 is automatically calculated and inserted in the CIF by SHELXL-97 might 
 generate A-level ALERTS when significant numbers of reflections are
 missing at higher theta values. In order to avoid such an ALERT,   
 substitute the values calculated with the SHELXL instruction 'ACTA 50' 
 for _diffrn_reflns_theta_full and _diffrn_measured_fraction_theta_full 
 respectively. For Mo-radiation, corresponding values of 25 degees (or  
 higher) and 0.99 (or higher) are expected. (See SHELXL manual).
 PLATON may be used to analyse the case at hand (by invoking either the 
 'FCF-VALIDATION' mode or the 'ASYM-VIEW' mode).

 This test checks whether a refined extinction parameter is meaningful  
 i.e. whether its value is significantly larger than its corresponding s.u. 
 If not, this parameter should be removed from the model and the structure  
 refined without this meaningless additional parameter. 
 The current default gives a warning when its value is within 3.33 s.u. 
 SHELXL97-2 will not allow negative values leading to ill-convergence and   
 non-zero maximum shift/error values: remove extinction parameter from the  
 refinement.

Std. Uncertainty on Flack Parameter Value High . $F Report  

 Check the validity of the absolute structure determination.
 A high s.u. indicates that the experimental data do not support the
 determination of the absolute structure. This will generally be the case   
 with light atom MoKa data where f" is nearly zero. 

 Note: Use the TWIN & BASF 0.0 instructions in SHELXL97. The default
 FLACK parameter is not always reliable, in particular when strongly
 correlated with the position of the origin (e.g. along y in space-group P21).  

 Please refer to Flack,H.D. & Bernardinelli, G. (1999) Acta Cryst. A55,

 908-915 and (2000) J. Appl. Cryst., 33, 1143-1148. 

 A value of the Flack parameter that deviates significantly from zero   
 (taking into account the associated s.u.) might indicate that the  
 absolute structure should be inverted in case of a value closer to 1.0 
 than to zero. A value close to 0.5 may be indicative of an inversion   
 twin or a missed centre of inversion.  

 For valid absolute structure assignments, abs(x) should be less than   
 2 * s.u., with s.u. < 0.04. For enantiopure compounds, s.u. should be less 
 than 0.1.

Correction for Absorption Required   RT(exp) ... $F Do !

 You have indicated that an absorption correction has not been applied. 
 (_exptl_absorpt_correction_type 'none'). However, the predicted values of  
 Tmin & Tmax, based on the crystal dimensions given in the CIF, are 
 sufficiently unequal that absorption effects appear to be significant. 
 Therefore, the application of a suitable absorption correction would   
 appear to be required. Also check that the crystal dimensions given in the 
 CIF do represent the actual crystal dimensions as closely as possible. 
 Inaccuracies here can lead to a poor prediction of Tmin & Tmax and give
 rise to these alerts. It should normally be possible to estimate the   
 crystal dimensions to 2 decimal places. Rough estimates to only 1 decimal  
 place may be too inaccurate to provide reliable estimates of Tmin & Tmax.

 will in general be an integer. This is also the number checked for here.   
 The official definition calls for 'The effective number of electrons in the

 contributions and is calculated as:

 F(000) = [ (sum f~r~)^2^ + (sum f~i~)^2^ ]^1/2^

 The CIF contains an atom sitting on a special position with occupancy  
 specified as less than 1.0. This is often an error and the result of the   
 confusion of the notions 'occupancy' and 'population parameter'. The first 
 should be 1.0 for a fully occupied site. The latter multiplies the 
 site-symmetry with the occupancy. Thus, for a fully occupied site on a

 Optionally specify the Hall symbol. The Hall symbol provides an
 unambiguous definition of the space-group symmetry where the Hermann-  
 Mauguin symbol leaves room for alternative choices of the origin.  
 E.g. for space-group P21, the screw axis is in general taken to coincide   
 with the b-axis. However, sometimes it is chosen to be shifted by 1/4  
 in the c-axis direction to bring out the relation with P21/c. The Hall 
 symbols will be 'P 2yb' and 'P 2ybc' respectively.

 Crystal structures in general do not contain large solvent accessible voids
 in the lattice. Most structures lose their long-range ordering when solvent
 molecules leave the crystal. Only when the remaining network is strongly   
 bonded (e.g. zeolites and some hydrogen bonded networks) the crystal   
 structure may survive. 
 Residual voids in a structure may indicate the omission of (disordered)
 density from the model. Disordered density may go undetected when smeared  
 since peak search programs are not designed to locate maxima on density
 ridges. The presence or absence of residual density in the void may be 
 verified on a printed/plotted difference Fourier map or with PLATON/SQUEEZE.   
 Voids of 40 Ang**3 may accommodate H2O. Small molecules such as
 Tetrahydrofuran have typical volumes in the 100 to 200 Ang**3 range.   
 This test reports the volume of the largest solvent accessible void in the

D-H..A  Calc$X, Rep$Y, Dev.. $F Sigma   

 Hydrogen-Bond Angle D-H..A listed in the CIF is checked. Alerts are set at 
 1,2 and 3 sigma deviation levels.  

 This ALERT is generally related to incorrect symmetry codes. The symmetry  
 number s in the symmetry code s_pqr should correspond to the expression
 for s in the CIF. Those expressions can be different for different 
 software packages. E.g. pasting H-bond table data generated with PLATON
 into a CIF generated with SHELXL may raise this ALERT. Manual correction   
 of the symmetry code should be trivial.

 angles are close to 180 Deg. SHELXL97 will generate those 'torsions' for
